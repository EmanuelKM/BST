# BST
Binary Search Tree operations implemented in C with recursion
Operations implemented:
- creation of the data structure and insertion of data in it
- a function that tests if the structure follows the rules of an BST
- an operation to invert the BST (via inverting the pointers of the branches)
- a function to show the path between two nodes of the BST
- a function to show the BST using recursion (printing the node and visiting the left and the right sub-BST respectivally)
