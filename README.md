# BST
Binary Search Tree operations implemented in C with recursion.
Operations implemented:
- creation of the data structure and insertion of data in it
- a function that tests if the structure follows the rules of an BST
- an operation to invert the BST (via inverting the pointers of the branches)
- a function to show the path between two nodes of the BST
- a function to show the BST using recursion (printing the node and visiting the left and the right sub-BST respectivally) 

Menu:
1: Insert data in the created BST
2: Show the BST
3: Invert the data of the BST
4: Test if the data structure follows the rules of a BST
5: Requests two values which are inside the BST, shows the path starting from the first value and going to the second
0: Exit the program
